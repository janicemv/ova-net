**OVA-NET: A Global Initiative for Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation**

### Introduction
The XXI Journ√©e Scientifique du GRECOT, held on March 11, 2025, featured an introduction to OVA-NET, a global network dedicated to ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC). This initiative aims to standardize and improve fertility preservation techniques for young girls and women.

### The Need for OVA-NET
For the past 25 years, various centers worldwide have conducted OTC and ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) with their own protocols. However, there is no standardization in:
- Freezing protocols
- Transplantation procedures
- Cryoprotectants, media, equilibration times, and temperature profiles
- Surgical approaches for transplantation
- Reporting of reproductive outcomes

The lack of standardization makes it difficult to compare success rates and evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques. Live birth rates from OTC currently range from 18-41%, highlighting the need for a unified approach.

### Current Advancements in Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation
- Vitrification is gaining ground, with five reported live births.
- There is a need to analyze success rates across different age groups and medical conditions.
- Limited data exist on the transplantation outcomes in prepubertal girls.

### Goals and Key Questions of OVA-NET
OVA-NET aims to answer crucial questions such as:
- Which patients benefit the most from OTC and OTT?
- How can freezing and transplantation be optimized to enhance follicle survival?
- How can return rates be increased?
- Are patients receiving adequate follow-up care?
- What factors determine the success rates of these procedures?

### Structure and Governance of OVA-NET
To achieve its objectives, OVA-NET has established a structured governance system:
1. **Coordinating Board**
   - Comprises 6-8 experienced representatives
   - Responsible for managing and coordinating consortium activities
   - Establishes governance structure, website, and operational plan
2. **Steering Committee**
   - Includes two representatives (a clinician and a lab scientist) from each country
   - Defines strategic direction and oversees activities
3. **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)**
   - Composed of working groups focusing on specific aspects of ovarian tissue cryopreservation
   - Conducts global surveys on OTC and OTT practices
4. **General Assembly**
   - Includes all consortium members
   - Meets every six months to discuss updates and initiatives

### Standardization and Research Initiatives
OVA-NET is committed to developing standardized protocols and improving global practices through:
- Creating an international registry for clinical data
- Standardizing reporting of clinical outcomes
- Conducting subgroup analyses based on diagnosis and age
- Enhancing cryopreservation and transplantation techniques
- Establishing best practices for follow-up care

### Collaborations and Future Directions
To strengthen its mission, OVA-NET seeks alignment with other major consortia, including:
- ESHRE SIG on Fertility Preservation
- ISFP
- Oncofertility Consortium (US)
- FertiPROTEKT (Germany)

By uniting global expertise, OVA-NET aims to refine fertility preservation strategies, optimize protocols, and enhance reproductive outcomes for young girls and women worldwide.

**Together, we can standardize, improve, and advance ovarian tissue cryopreservation!**
